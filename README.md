# Breast-Cancer-project
The objective of this project is to classify whether breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this, I have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input. 


we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer. A few machine learning techniques will be explored. In this exercise, Support Vector Machine is being implemented with 99% accuracy.
